The plan is not valid due to the following issues: 

1. **Battery Depletion Before Charging:** In steps 9 and 19, the robot's battery level reaches 0% before the robot could move to the charging area. This would make it impossible for the robot to complete the move to the charging area to recharge, effectively stranding the robot at the building area with a depleted battery. 

To correct the schedule of tasks, consider the following instructions for the plan generator: 

   - Ensure the robot starts moving towards the charging area before the battery level drops to the minimum required for the journey back. Given that each move action consumes a certain percentage of battery (which appears to be 20% per movement between areas in this plan), the robot must begin its return journey to the charging area with at least this amount of battery remaining to avoid being stranded. 
   - Implement a check for the robot's battery level before it leaves the building area for the storage area or charging area. If the battery will deplete to 0% during the trip, the robot should first return to the charging area if it does not have enough battery to complete the next round of actions (move, pick, move, build). 
   - In this specific scenario, after step 8, instead of moving to the storage area with 20% battery, which leads to depletion, the robot should have returned to the charging area to recharge. Similarly, after step 18, the robot again ends up with 0% battery, indicating a need for an earlier decision to recharge before undertaking the move back to the charging area. 

A corrected sequence for steps 9 onwards, considering the robot should not attempt a move if it results in 0% battery before recharging, could be:
 - **Step 9:** Return to the charging area directly from the building area when the battery level is critically low (above 0% but below the threshold needed to safely return and perform essential actions). 
 - **Continue the pattern:** After charging, the robot should move to the storage area, pick materials, move to the building area, build, and return for charging when necessary, ensuring it always has enough battery for movements and actions.
